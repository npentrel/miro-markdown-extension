and click on the Markdown button:

> Select this widget and click the Markdown button at the bottom of the
screen!

The extension renders *emphasis* and _italics_ and also **emphasis and

Inline `code` also works! And code-blocks do too!

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

The code highlighting is based on [GreenAsh's Code Highlight](https://github.com/GreenAsh/code-highlighter)
extension which you may also want to download.
